## 🍍🎛️ **Korgamite** – Logging & Observability for the Modern Java Stack

### 🔍 Overview
**Korgamite** is a modular suite of Java libraries designed to bring rich, expressive **logging, tracing, and observability** to JVM-based applications — with an emphasis on clarity, minimalism, and developer delight.

Korgamite lets your system **sing** in logs, hum with metrics, and groove in distributed traces.

---

### 🧩 Core Modules

#### `korgamite-core`
> Lightweight, no-dependency logging foundation. Pluggable with SLF4J, Logback, or System.out. Optimized for low-GC impact and minimal log clutter.

- Structured log event DSL (`.log().info().with("user", id).message("User logged in")`)
- Context-aware logging scopes
- Built-in JSON and key-value formatters

---

#### `korgamite-trace`
> Adds distributed tracing with native OpenTelemetry support.

- Drop-in support for Jaeger, Zipkin, or OTLP exporters
- Auto-context propagation across HTTP/gRPC/Async
- Annotate traces with `@Traceable` or custom spans via fluent API

---

#### `korgamite-metrics`
> Clean, expressive metrics integration with Micrometer-style API.

- Gauges, counters, histograms, timers
- JVM, thread, GC, and memory metrics baked in
- Exporters for Prometheus, Graphite, InfluxDB, and more

---

#### `korgamite-watchtower`
> Centralized logging and telemetry dashboard connector.

- Stream logs and traces to Elasticsearch, Loki, or custom sinks
- Real-time log tailing with structured filters
- Simple YAML/Java DSL config

---

#### `korgamite-synth`
> Experimental module for **reactive logs**, **log sampling strategies**, and **sonification** of metrics (yeah, it can make your logs *sound* cool).

---

### 🌈 Design Philosophy

- **Synth-clear syntax**: Fluent, expressive APIs you *want* to use
- **No log noise**: Smart filtering, context scoping, and event tagging
- **Composable**: Bring only the modules you need, keep the rest light
- **Dev-centric**: IDE-friendly, annotation-aware, built for humans

---

### 🛠 Example Usage

```java
import static io.korgamite.Log;

public class UserService {

    public void login(String userId) {
        Log.info()
            .with("user.id", userId)
            .with("event", "login_attempt")
            .message("User login initiated");
    }
}
```

---

### 🔗 Integration

- **Spring Boot**: Auto-config available via `korgamite-spring-boot-starter`
- **Micronaut / Quarkus**: Native support via annotations and context beans
- **Kubernetes**: Sidecar metrics collector + log enrichment hooks

---

### 🧬 Origin Story

> *Forged deep in the analog forests of the JVM, Korgamite is both natural and electric — a mineral of clarity in the noisy caverns of distributed systems.*

Want a sample project, logo, or Maven archetype mockup to go with it? I can whip that up.
